##International Space Station
The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest structure ever built in orbit and the most complex engineering project in the Earth's history. The first main component of this 'space station' was launched into orbit in November 1998 and the first crew took up residence in October 2000. The station has been occupied continuously since then.

The ISS is primarily a science research station, studying processes in micro gravity, long term exposure of materials in space and the effects on people living in near zero gravity. It is also inspiring innovations in technology, engineering and spacecraft design.
