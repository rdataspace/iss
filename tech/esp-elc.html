				<p>External Stowage Platform 2. [ESP-2] was based on the deployable version of the Integrated Cargo Carriers [ICC], which was designed to transport un-pressurized cargo inside the U.S Space Shuttle's cargo bay.</p>
				<p>It was installed on the Joint Airlock (Quest) using a specialized ESP Attachment Device (ESPAD) in July 2005. This was during the U.S. Space Shuttle's STS-114 (Flight LF-1) mission. The Shuttle's robot arm and two space walkers assisted with the installation.</p>
				<p>ESP-2 is larger than ESP-1 being approximately 8.5 feet (2.6 m) long and 14 feet (4.3 m) wide. It is powered from Node 1 (Unity).</p>

				<p>External Stowage Platform 3. [ESP-3] was based on the deployable version of the Integrated Cargo Carriers [ICC], which was designed to transport un-pressurized cargo inside the U.S Space Shuttle's cargo bay. It was initially installed on the P3 Truss Segment of the ITS during the Shuttle mission STS-118 (Flight 13A.1) in 2007.</p>
				<p>ESP-3 was the first major station element to be installed completely by robotics, using only the shuttle and station's robotic arms, an external berthing camera system (BCS) and a Photovoltaic Radiator Grapple Fixture (PVRGF).</p>
				<p>In 2010 ESP-3 was moved to the bottom of S3 truss segment of the ITS. It was grappled by the stations robotic arm and transferred down the ITS on the mobile transporter [MT]. This cleared the way for ExPRESS Logistics Carrier-3 [ELC-3] to be installed later.</p>
				<p>ESP-3 is the same size as ESP-2 with two grapple fixtures, hand rails, tether attachment points and foot restraints for astronauts.</p>
