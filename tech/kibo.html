					<p>The transferred item must be smaller than 460 x 830 x 800 mm and must not exceed 300kg, the mass transfer capacity of the slide table. It is not designed for space walkers.</p>
					<p>The airlock is cylindrical and consists of an inner hatch, outer hatch and a slide table.<br>

					<p>The ELM-ES was the last component of the JEM to be delivered to the station. It was transported by U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour STS-127 [Flight 2J/A] in July 2009 and attached to port end of the EF.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>Sub-systems</h3>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">The ELM-ES is composed of five primary subsystems: structural, mechanical, power, communication and thermal control.</p>

					<h4>Structural Sub-system</h4>
					<p>The design of the ELM-ES structure considers load factors such as those imposed during launch and retrieval by the Space Shuttle and those imposed on orbit. It has five attachment points for securing it in the pay-load bay of the Space Shuttle during transport to and from the Station. Its main structure is composed of a grid shaped panel/frame to facilitate the attachment of experiment pay-loads. The ELM-ES accommodates three exposed pay-loads, each weighing a maximum of 500kg.</p>

					</figure>

					<h4>Mechanical Subsystem</h4>
					<p>The ELM-ES is equipped with pay-load Attachment Mechanisms (PAMs) which secure experiment pay-loads to the Structural Subsystem during transport to and from the Station by the Space Shuttle.</p>
					<p>The PAMs also support attaching and detaching pay-loads on orbit by the Kibo robot arm. Each PAM has an electric connector which supplies power to the experiment pay-loads.</p>

					<h4>Power Sub-system</h4>
					<p>The ELM-ES power subsystem is supplied 120Vdc power by the EF power subsystem.</p>
					<p>It then distributes a maximum of 1kW of power to system equipment and experiment pay-loads through the Power Control Unit (PCU).</p>

					<h4>Communication Sub-system</h4>
					<p>The communication sub-system is controlled by the Pressurized Module (PM) control system through the Electric Control Unit (ECU). It monitors the status of the ELM-ES, performs power control and PAM torque control, and controls the temperature for equipment including experiment pay-loads.</p>

					<h4>Thermal Control Sub-system</h4>
					<p class="mb0">The ELM-ES is covered with Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) to prevent excessive cooling due to heat loss in the low-temperature environment. System equipment or experiment pay-loads can also be warmed by a heater where the MLI is unable to sustain the required thermal conditions.<span id="rms"></span></p>

					<p>The JEM Remote Manipulator System [JEMRMS] is a robotic arm system designed to support and manipulate experiments and perform maintenance tasks on the JEM un-pressurized facilities.</p>

						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The JEMRMS is composed of two arms, a 10m long Main Arm (MA) and a shorter 2m long Small Fine Arm (SFA). The MA is primarily used to transfer large objects, and the SFA to handle the smaller, more delicate items. Both arms have six independent joints and provide dexterity in movement, similar to the human arm.</p>
					<p>The MA is permanently connected to the port end of the Pressurized Module [PM]. The SFA is stored on the Exposed Facility [EF] and attached to the end of the MA when needed. The robotic control workstation in the PM, known as the JEMRMS Console, is used for manipulating the arms. Remote television cameras are mounted on both arms to assist in their control.</p>
					<p>The arms are used to exchange exposed pay-loads and ORUs between the EF and the Experiment Logistics Module - Exposed Section [ELM-ES]. They are also used to place and remove items on the PM's scientific airlock tray.</p>
					<p>The JEMRMS is designed to operate for more than 10 years in orbit and incorporates a modular design which allows many major components to be exchanged or replaced in case of failure.</p>
